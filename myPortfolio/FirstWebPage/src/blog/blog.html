                <h1>Questions that need answering 2.</h1>
                <h3>What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?</h3> You can use media queries and css grids to hide and show content or rather arrange content based upon screen width. As for screen readers, make sure the title tag is accurate for the website, make the content itself descriptive to better convey meaning, and make sure everything can be read by a screen reader software. Additionally, it is also possible to use css grids and media queries to arrange the website into essentially a landmarks page which acts like a table of contents for the whole website. Which is of course something that can be easily read by a screen reader.
                <h3>Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.</h3> Basically BFC is code that is designed to contain web content and prevent it from overflowing on the webpage, like margin collapsing. Usually in the css classes we would use tags like overflow: auto or overflow: visible to help contain .floats inside a container and prevent it from spilling over other web content. This can also be accomplished by applying display: flow-root onto a class to achieve the same effect.
                <h3>Describe something you learned in class today.</h3> Media queries. Media queries are fascinating to me, because it finally answered how a website transforms itself to adjust to any device. Additionally, it helps construct conditional situations that can determent the outlook of a webpage based on width, and possibly other elements as well. Combining the use of Media Queries with CSS Grids can more easily aid the construction of a site's layout for future projects.
                <h3>What's the difference between inline and inline-block?</h3> Basically an inline-block allows you to set a width and height when defining the element. Also, compared to an inline, the inline-block pays respect to the margins and padding of other elements while the inline ignores them. So compared to a standard inline, an inline-block allows a better display on the webpage.
                <h3>How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?</h3> Always build responsive layouts. As you develop code, test it in all browsers and make changes as needed. The website doesn't have to look exactly the same on every browser it just needs to be presentable and functional across the board.

                <h1>Questions that need answering.</h1>
                <h3>What is GIT?</h3> Git is basically version control, storage, and management of source code
                <h3>What are the advantages of using GIT?</h3> Allows code to be manipulated by multiple people while preserving an original unaltered version of the previous source code installment.
                <h3>What language is used in GIT?</h3>Git is written C, Shell, Perl, Tcl, Python.
                <h3>Why is GIT better than Subversion?</h3>Git can allow changes in code to happen locally on a device while svn still needs to check out files and commit changes back to the server. So when developing code in GIT you don't have to be connected all the time.
                <h3>Describe one thing you learned in class today.</h3>"Outside In" development of code. Rather than blindly build a webpage from scratch its easier to characterize the page as like building a house. The header is your front yard, the footer is your back yard, the main is house itself, the articles are individual rooms, and the actual content that goes into the articles are like furniture. Each part of the house can have a pseudo-class assigned to them in css, which can allow not only for easier design of the webpage but also some diversity when needed. After all, you need tile in the master bathroom not the master bedroom, so different css styles or pseudo-classes need to be assigned to the appropriate article.
                <h3>Describe your workflow and recommended workflow practice when you create a web page?</h3>In the past I would blindly start producing content onto a webpage and improvise as i go along. Big mistake, i run into so many problems. Now to make things go smother i follow the "Outside In" philosophy of developing code that I've previously mentioned in the last question above.
                <h3>Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website accessible.</h3>ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Its basically a technical specification that helps specify how to increase the accessibility of webpages usually via dynamic content and user interface components.
                Screen reader is a assistive technology that helps convey what is displayed on a webpage screen. Its a technology that's primarily used for the blind, visually impaired, learning disabled, or illiterate. Pretty much goes hand and hand with what ARIA is.
                Based what i researched online I'll go ahead and put this short list on how to make a website more accessible.
                <br>
                1. Make Sure Site is Keyboard-Friendly <br>
                2. Make Sure All Content is Easily Accessible <br>
                3. Add Alt Text to All Images <br>
                4. Choose appropriate colors <br>
                5. Use Headers to structure content correctly <br>
                6. Design all forms for accessibility <br>
                7. Don't use Tables for Anything except Tabular Data <br>
                8. Enable Resizable Text that doesn't break your site <br>
                9. Avoid automatic Media and Navigation <br>
                10. Create content with accessibility in mind. <br>
