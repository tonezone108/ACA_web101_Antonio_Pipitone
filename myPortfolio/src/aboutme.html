            My name is Antonio Pipitone. I'm just another run of the mill disgruntled millennial trying to carve out a peaceful existence in the mad mad world called life. I've been working and studying for years trying to find my proper course in life and just like many of people in the world I haven't found it just yet. I don't let such things discourage me though. Even though I've faced many challenges I still find ways to enjoy life. Some of my interests and hobbies include karate, vegetarian cuisine, physical fitness, meditation, Vedic philosophy, cartoons, Japanese language and culture, history, world religions, and whatever video game that manages to grasp my attention in my free time. I may be growing older every day but I hardly notice it. I've been knocked off my horse many times and gotten back up. Despite every bad thing that has ever happened to me I can confidently say that unlike many people I've learned how to deal with failure and disappointment very early in my life. The future does not make me paranoid and I'm ready for any challenge I must face. I already anticipate many moments of pain and strain but it does not bother me. <strong style="color: red;">For I am the sculptor of my own destiny.</strong>               </p></div>

            I graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio in class of 2015 with a Bachelors in Modern Language studies with an emphasis in Japanese. While in college I was also the acting president for the UTSA Club for Applied Spiritual Technology from 2013 to 2015. While attending university I was able to go abroad to Japan, twice. Once for a study tour in the summer of 2013, and secondly to study abroad at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University during the summer of 2015 in Beppu Japan. Of all the places I visited in Japan my absolute favorite site to visit was the Nagasaki Peace Park where the iconic Peace Statue meditates while protecting the city from all harm. After college I found it difficult to find employment anywhere, so I while I worked very simple jobs I started to self teach myself coding at home through w3schools.com. As it turns out studying coding was almost exactly like studying another language. I simply applied the same logic of learning the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of Japanese, I similar began learning the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of coding languages. Eventually I managed to take the websites certification tests and acquire a w3schools certification in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. Despite this I still did not manage to break into the tech industry. After being laid off from one job I decided to go back to school again for a year and study Java which helped further increase my expertise in computer programing. Despite this as well I still found no real employment in the IT industry and had to find employment anywhere again. Then once again after being laid off for the second time i decided to go back to school for the third time at Austin Coding Academy. This is my final attempt at anything inside this country. For while I was unemployed before coming to ACA, I did manage to get a Teach English as Foreign Language certification, in case I want to go to Japan to be a English teacher.

                    I've worked odd jobs here and there after graduating college. I've haven't had the chance to settle down into an actual career in anything. The most relevant experiences I've had working while working was when I worked as a help desk technician for the Home Depot Technology center. That was a job that involved being a helpful problem solver who knows how to deal with people and solve computer problems over the phone. The only other relevant experience I have was working as a data analyst / managers assistant in the office at a Wesco manufacturing firm. That was a job that involved analyzing spread sheets, updating prices on parts, and assisting the manager in whatever task he needed help with, which would occasionally involve solving computer problems. All of that was before I got laid off. Now I'm humbly working part time at my local grocery store while I go to school. Its not much, but its honest and straightforward work for the time being. Otherwise I would like to call my self a Jack of All Trades , at least in the sense I don't really care what responsibilities a job entails. I always like to roll up my sleeves and perform any task with quality. In the event I don't know how to do something I always adapt and learn how, and always be flexible and capable of learning new things on the spot.
